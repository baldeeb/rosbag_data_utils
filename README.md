# rosbag_data_utils

Tools that facilitate processing rosbag data as dictionaries and storing them in RLBench 
friendly format.

This tools was built for [RPM lab's](https://rpm-lab.github.io/) work on 
[training Boston Dynamics' Spot](https://baldeeb.github.io/blog/2023/spot-bosdyn-work/) 
to use [PerAct](https://github.com/peract/peract) for task learning. The tool swas used 
with the lab's UR5 robots afterwards.

- `examples.ipynb` for examples on initializing the primary classes.
- `bag_to_rlbench.ipynb` for reference on storing data as RLBench files.
